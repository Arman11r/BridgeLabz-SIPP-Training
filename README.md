# 🚀 BridgeLabz SIPP Training Assignments

This repository documents my daily progress through the BridgeLabz SIPP Core Java training. It contains assignments on Java fundamentals, control structures, arrays, string handling, and object-oriented programming.

> **Note:**  
> - All core Java practice files (Day1 to Day5 and Extras) are maintained in the `CoreJava` branch.  
> - All Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) files are pushed and organized in the `OOPS` branch under `oopsjava.` packages.

## 📁 Folder Overview

### 📌 Day1 – Java Basics *(in `CoreJava` branch)*
Uploaded foundational Java programs including variables, calculations, unit conversions, and discount applications. Learned basic syntax and console I/O.

### 📌 Day2_ControlFlow *(in `CoreJava` branch)*
Focused on conditional statements and logical decision-making using `if`, `else-if`, and `switch-case` constructs.

### 📌 Day3_Arrays *(in `CoreJava` branch)*
Implemented assignments related to 1D arrays, including basic computations, table generation, and structured looping.

### 📌 Day4_Methods *(in `CoreJava` branch)*
Learned modular programming using user-defined methods, return types, and parameter passing.

### 📌 Day5_Strings *(in `CoreJava` branch)*
Explored Java string operations, manual parsing, character handling, and custom logic for string manipulation.

### 📌 EXTRAS_built_in_functions & EXTRAS_java_string_handling *(in `CoreJava` branch)*
Worked on built-in Java utilities, string API usage, and exception-safe logic.

## 💡 OOPS Concepts *(in `OOPS` branch)*

These files are available in the **`OOPS` branch** under the `oopsjava.` package. They demonstrate concepts of object-oriented programming:

- **oopsjava.day1javaclassandmethods**  
  Created and managed classes, constructors, and instance methods.

- **oopsjava.day2ConstructorsInstancevsClassAccessModifiers**  
  Differentiated between instance vs static methods, and practiced access control.

- **oopsjava.day3thisStaticFinalKeywordAndInstanceCount**  
  Used `this`, `static`, and `final` keywords to control behavior and memory.

- **oopsjava.day4ObjectOrientedDesignPrinciples**  
  Applied core OOP design principles like encapsulation, association, and communication between classes.
