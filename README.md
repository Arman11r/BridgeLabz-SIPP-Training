# 🚀 BridgeLabz SIPP Training Assignments

This repository documents my daily progress through the BridgeLabz SIPP Core Java training. It contains assignments on Java fundamentals, control structures, arrays, string handling, and object-oriented programming.

> **Note:**  
> - All core Java practice files (Day1 to Day5 and Extras) are maintained in the `CoreJava` branch.  
> - All Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) files are pushed and organized in the `OOPS` branch under `oopsjava.` packages.

## 📁 Folder Overview (CoreJava Branch)

### 📌 Day1 – Java Basics
Uploaded foundational Java programs including variables, calculations, unit conversions, and discount applications. Learned basic syntax and console I/O.

### 📌 Day2_ControlFlow
Focused on conditional statements and logical decision-making using `if`, `else-if`, and `switch-case` constructs.

### 📌 Day3_Arrays
Implemented assignments related to 1D arrays, including basic computations, table generation, and structured looping.

### 📌 Day4_Methods
Learned modular programming using user-defined methods, return types, and parameter passing.

### 📌 Day5_Strings
Explored Java string operations, manual parsing, character handling, and custom logic for string manipulation.

### 📌 EXTRAS_built_in_functions
Practiced built-in Java utility methods like `Math`, `Random`, and `Arrays`.

### 📌 EXTRAS_java_string_handling
Focused on in-depth string manipulation using Java's built-in string APIs and exception handling.

## 📦 Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS Branch)

### 📌 oopsjava.day1javaclassandmethods
Created and used classes and objects, learned about instance variables, method definitions, and object initialization. This formed the base for OOP understanding.

### 📌 oopsjava.day2ConstructorsInstancevsClassAccessModifiers
Explored constructor overloading, differences between instance and class-level members (`static`), and applied access modifiers (`public`, `private`, `protected`).

### 📌 oopsjava.day3thisStaticFinalKeywordAndInstanceCount
Studied `this` keyword for disambiguating variables, implemented object counting using `static`, and used `final` to enforce constants.

### 📌 oopsjava.day4ObjectOrientedDesignPrinciples
Applied real-world modeling with OOP design principles such as encapsulation, association, communication between classes, and abstraction using practical scenarios.
